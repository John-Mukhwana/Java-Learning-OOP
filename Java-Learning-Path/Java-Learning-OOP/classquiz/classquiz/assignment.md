1.In Java, the this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. It's used to avoid confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name or to call other constructors within the same class.


2.The super keyword in Java refers to the parent (or superclass) of a class. It can be used for the following purposes:

Accessing superclass methods when they are overridden in the subclass.
Accessing superclass constructors to initialize the superclass's fields.
Accessing superclass variables if they are hidden by the subclass.
